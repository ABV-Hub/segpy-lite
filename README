SegyPY : A Python module for reading/writing of SEG-Y formatted files
Copyright (C) 2005 Thomas Mejer Hansen, cultpenguin@gmail.com

Currently you can only READ (not write) IBM Floats, IEEE, 1, 2 and 4 byte INTEGER formatted data.

With time I would like the module to have the capabilities of SegyMAT : http://segymat.sf.net/
