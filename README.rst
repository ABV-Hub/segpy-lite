What is Segpy?
==============

The SEG Y file format is one of several standards developed by the Society of Exploration Geophysicists for storing
geophysical seismic data. It is an open standard, and is controlled by the SEG Technical Standards Committee, a
non-profit organization.

This project aims to implement an open SEG Y module in Python for transporting seismic data between SEG Y files and
Numpy arrays. Segpy is a package for reading, writing and manipulating SEG Y data in pure Python.
